## Installation

To get started with the Instructor Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/instructor-dashboard.git
    cd instructor-dashboard
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Node.js and Composer installed. Then run:
    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install && npm run dev
    ```

3. **Database Setup**:
    - Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    - Update your `.env` file with your database credentials.

4. **Migrate the Database**:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

5. **Generate Application Key**:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. **Seed the Database (Optional)**:
    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

7. **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

## Configuration

The main configurations are set in the `.env` file, where you can adjust the database, mail, and other environment-specific settings.
